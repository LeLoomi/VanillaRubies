 - [x] Item
 - [x] (Deepslate) Ore block, gem block
 - [x] Armor
 - [x] Tools
 - [x] Ore generation
 - [ ] Villager trading
 - [ ] Stat balancing

Supported languages: *English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic*.\
This mod is only available for [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), MC Version 1.19.\
